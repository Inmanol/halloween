                <p>In the Halloween party there are many customs that are repeated every year. Next, we will show you the main ones:</p>
                <p id="customs">-Costumes: personally, this is the most important to scare people on the street. We can dress as a mummy, vampire or zombie.</p>
                <p id="pumpkins">-Pumpkins: they are almost necessary for a Halloween night. Legend has it that it kills spirits.</p>
                <p id="pumpkins2">You can create or buy it but you have to have a candle.</p>
                <p id="trickortreat">-Trick or treat: another custom in halloween. It is made in Spain to eat jellybeans and sweets. Always have sweets to give!</p>
                <p id="blackcats">-Black cats: very common in the night of fear. Legend has it that heâ€™s the friend of the witch.</p>
